        /*JavaScript Programs
        A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.
        
        These programming instructions are called statements.
        
        Most JavaScript programs contain many statements.
        Semicolons ;
Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.

Add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement:
        The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written.*/ 
        let x, y, z;  //This is a single line comment  // Statement 1
        x = 5;          // Statement 2
        y = 6;          // Statement 3
        
        z = x + y;      // Statement 4
        document.write(z);  // Statement 5
        
        // this is a multi line comment
        /*JavaScript Statements
        JavaScript statements are composed of:
        
        Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.
        
        This statement tells the browser to write "Hello Dolly." inside an HTML element with id="demo":*/
        document.getElementById("Demo").innerHTML="Welcome to Js"
/*JavaScript White Space
JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable.

The following lines are equivalent:*/
let boy=     "person";
let boy1="person"; 
document.write("<br>");
document.write(boy);
// this below comment prevent execution if the code above it
// document.write(boy1);
