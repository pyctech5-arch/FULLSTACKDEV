    <!-- var is function-scoped and can be redeclared.
let and const are block-scoped.
let allows reassignment, const does not. -->
    <script>
        var name = "John";
        console.log(name); // Output: John

        let age = 30;
        console.log(age); // Output: 30

        const pi = 3.14;
        console.log(pi); // Output: 3.14

        // var can be redeclared
        var name = "Doe";
        console.log(name); // Output: Doe

        // let cannot be redeclared
        // let age = 25; // This will cause an error

        // const cannot be redeclared or reassigned
        // const pi = 3.14159; // This will cause an error
    </script>
    <!-- When to Use var, let, or const?
1. Always declare variables

2. Always use const if the value should not be changed

3. Always use const if the type should not be changed (Arrays and Objects)

4. Only use let if you cannot use const

5. Never use var if you can use let or const. -->
<!-- JavaScript Data Types
JavaScript variables can hold 8 datatypes, but for now, just think of numbers and strings.

Strings are text written inside quotes.

Numbers are written without quotes.

If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string.

Example
const pi = 3.14;
let person = "John Doe";
let answer = 'Yes I am!'; -->

<!-- One Statement, Many Variables
You can declare many variables in one statement.

Start the statement with let or constand separate the variables by comma:

Example
let person = "John Doe", carName = "Volvo", price = 200; -->
<script>
    // A declaration can span multiple lines:

// Example
let person = "John Doe",
carName = "Volvo",
price = 200;
document.write(person + "<br>" + carName + "<br>" + price);
// The Assignment Operator
// In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an assignment operator, not an equal to operator.

// This is different from algebra. The following does not make sense in algebra:

x = x + 5;
// In JavaScript, however, it makes perfect sense: it assigns the value of x + 5 to x.

// (It calculates the value of x + 5 and puts the result into x. The value of x is incremented by 5.)
</script>
<script>
    document.write("<br>","<br>");
// Note:
// If you put a number in quotes, the rest of the numbers will be treated as strings, and concatenated.
let a = "5" + 2 + 3;
document.write(a); // Output: 523
</script>
<!-- The let keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015)

Variables declared with let have Block Scope

Variables declared with let must be Declared before use

Variables declared with let cannot be Redeclared in the same scope

Block Scope
Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript did not have Block Scope.

JavaScript had Global Scope and Function Scope.

ES6 introduced the two new JavaScript keywords: let and const.

These two keywords provided Block Scope in JavaScript:

Example
Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:

{
  let x = 2;
}
// x can NOT be used here
Function Scope 
Inside a function all variables declared with var, let or const have Function Scope:

Example-->
<script>
    var x = 2;
    document.write(x);
    // we cannot redeclare the value of let type 
    let c=1;
    // let c=2; // This will cause an error, as we cannot redeclare a variable declared with let
    c=12; // This is allowed, as we are reassigning the value, not redeclaring it
    // { let c=12;} this is alowed as we know let is block scope so we can declare it in another block
    let d=1; // This is allowed, as we are declaring a new variable
    document.write("<br>",c,"<br>",d);
</script>
<script>
    // in const type we cannot redeclare the value also we cannot reassign the value
    const f=2;
// const f=3; // This will cause an error, as we cannot redeclare a variable declared with const 
// f=4; // This will cause an error, as we cannot reassign a variable declared with const



</script>
  <!-- What is Good?
let and const have block scope.

let and const can not be redeclared.

let and const must be declared before use.

let and const does not bind to this.

let and const are not hoisted.

What is Not Good?
var does not have to be declared.

var is hoisted.

var binds to this. -->
