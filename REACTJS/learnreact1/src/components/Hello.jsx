/*Why Use Portals
Portals are particularly useful for:

Modals and dialogs
Tooltips
Floating menus
Notifications
Any UI element that needs to "break out" of its container's layout, especially when the parent component has:

overflow: hidden
z-index conflicts
Complex positioning requirements*/ 
    /*The first argument (children) is any renderable React content, like elements, strings, or fragments.

The second argument (domNode) is a DOM element where the portal should be inserted instead.

Creating a Modal with Portal
React Portals are particularly useful for components like modals, tooltips, and dialogs that need to break out of their container's layout.

Here is an example of a modal component where the modal is rendered outside the parent component's DOM hierarchy:*/

React Portals provide a way to render HTML outside the parent component's DOM hierarchy.

What are React Portals?
A Portal is a React method that is included in the react-dom package.

It is used to render HTML outside the parent component's DOM hierarchy.

Normally the returned HTML element is a child of the parent component, and returned like this: */}
{/* But by using the createPortal method, the HTML is not a child of the parent component, and is rendered outside the parent component's DOM hierarchy: */}
<MyApp/>
    </div>
