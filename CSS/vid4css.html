    <!--CSS Comments
Comments are used to explain the CSS code, and may help when you edit the source code at a later date.

Comments are also used to temporarily disable sections of CSS code within a stylesheet.

Comments are ignored by browsers!

A CSS comment is placed inside the HTML <style> element, and starts with /* and ends with */:  -->
