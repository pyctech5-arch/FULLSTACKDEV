    <!-- CSS Selectors
CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
This page will explain the most basic CSS selectors. -->
<!-- The CSS element Selector
The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name. -->

<h1>My First CSS Example</h1>

<!-- The CSS id Selector
The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.

The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!

To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element. -->
<h1 id="myHeader">My First CSS Example</h1>
<!-- The CSS class Selector
The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.

To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name. -->
<!-- also we can define more then one class to the html element -->
<h1 class="myClass myclass1">My First CSS Example</h1>

<!-- The CSS Universal Selector
The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page. -->
<!--  /* this is an example for universal selector */                -->
<style>
*{
    text-align: center;
}
</style>
<!-- The CSS Grouping Selector
The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions.

Look at the following CSS code (the h1, h2, and p elements have the same style definitions): -->
<h3>Hi Every one</h3>
<h2>My Name :Prashant</h2>
