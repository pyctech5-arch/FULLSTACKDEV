    <!-- Html action attribute specifies where to send the form data when the form is submitted -->
<!-- OR -->
     <!-- The action attribute defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted.

Usually, the form data is sent to a file on the server when the user clicks on the submit button.

In the example below, the form data is sent to a file called "action_page.php". This file contains a server-side script that handles the form data: -->

 <!-- If the action attribute is omitted, the action is set to the current page. -->
  <!-- The Target Attribute
The target attribute specifies where to display the response that is received after submitting the form.

The target attribute can have one of the following values:

Value	Description
_blank	The response is displayed in a new window or tab
_self	The response is displayed in the current window
_parent	The response is displayed in the parent frame
_top	The response is displayed in the full body of the window
framename	The response is displayed in a named iframe
The default value is _self which means that the response will open in the current window. -->


<!-- method attribute    -->
 Notes on GET:

<!-- Appends the form data to the URL, in name/value pairs
NEVER use GET to send sensitive data! (the submitted form data is visible in the URL!)
The length of a URL is limited (2048 characters)
Useful for form submissions where a user wants to bookmark the result
GET is good for non-secure data, like query strings in Google
Notes on POST:

Appends the form data inside the body of the HTTP request (the submitted form data is not shown in the URL)
POST has no size limitations, and can be used to send large amounts of data.
Form submissions with POST cannot be bookmarked -->

    <!-- The Autocomplete Attribute
    The autocomplete attribute specifies whether a form should have autocomplete on or off.

    When autocomplete is on, the browser automatically complete values based on values that the user has entered before. -->

    <!-- The Novalidate Attribute
The novalidate attribute is a boolean attribute.

When present, it specifies that the form-data (input) should not be validated when submitted. -->
    <form action="coding man.gif" target="_blank" method="get" autocomplete="on" >
   <input type="text" name="fname" ><br>
    <input type="text" name="lname" ><br>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>
