What is Multimedia?

<!-- HTML Vedio tag -->
 <video width="320" height="240" controls autoplay muted loop >
    <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

<!-- How it Works
The controls attribute adds video controls, like play, pause, and volume.

It is a good idea to always include width and height attributes. If height and width are not set, the page might flicker while the video loads.

The <source> element allows you to specify alternative video files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.

The text between the <video> and </video> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the <video> element. -->

    <video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="forrest_gump.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="forrest_gump.ogg" type="video/ogg">
  <track src="fgsubtitles_en.vtt" kind="subtitles" srclang="en" label="English">
  <track src="fgsubtitles_no.vtt" kind="subtitles" srclang="no" label="Norwegian">
</video>

<!-- Definition and Usage
The <track> tag specifies text tracks for <audio> or <video> elements.

This element is used to specify subtitles, caption files or other files containing text, that should be visible when the media is playing.

Tracks are formatted in WebVTT format (.vtt files). -->

The HTML <audio> Element

HTML Audio - How It Works
The controls attribute adds audio controls, like play, pause, and volume.

The <source> element allows you to specify alternative audio files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.

The text between the <audio> and </audio> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the <audio> element.

HTML <audio> Autoplay
To start an audio file automatically, use the autoplay attribute:

Note: Chromium browsers do not allow autoplay in most cases. However, muted autoplay is always allowed.

Add muted after autoplay to let your audio file start playing automatically (but muted):
