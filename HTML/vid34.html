<!-- Plug-ins are computer programs that extend the standard functionality of the browser.

Plug-ins
Plug-ins were designed to be used for many different purposes:

To run Java applets
To run Microsoft ActiveX controls
To display Flash movies
To display maps
To scan for viruses
To verify a bank id

Warning !

Most browsers no longer support Java Applets and Plug-ins.

ActiveX controls are no longer supported in any browsers.

The support for Shockwave Flash has also been turned off in modern browsers.


The <object> Element
The <object> element is supported by all browsers.

The <object> element defines an embedded object within an HTML document.

It was designed to embed plug-ins (like Java applets, PDF readers, and Flash Players) in web pages, but can also be used to include HTML in HTML:

Example -->
    <object width="100%" height="500px" data="vid9.html"></object>
     <object width="100%" height="500px" data="workplace.jpg"></object>

     <!-- The <embed> Element
The <embed> element is supported in all major browsers.

The <embed> element also defines an embedded object within an HTML document.

Web browsers have supported the <embed> element for a long time. However, it has not been a part of the HTML specification before HTML5. -->

        <embed width="100%" height="500px" src="vid9.html"></embed>
        <embed width="100%" height="500px" src="workplace.jpg"></embed>
</body>
</html>
